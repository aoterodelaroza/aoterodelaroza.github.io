## Introduction

The [non-covalent interaction plots](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja100936w)
are graphical
representations of the regions where the densities of two interacting
molecules overlap. The accumulation of density in the intermolecular
space, which is related to the amount of intermolecular repulsion, can
be used to qualitatively infer the strength of the interaction.
The implementation of NCI plots in critic2 works with molecules and
with [periodic solids](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C2CP41395G). NCI
plots can be created using the NCIPLOT keyword:
~~~
NCIPLOT
  ONAME root.s
  CUTOFFS rhocut.r dimcut.r
  RHOPARAM rhoparam.r
  RHOPARAM2 rhoparam2.r
  CUTPLOT rhoplot.r dimplot.r
  SRHORANGE srhomin.r srhomax.r
  VOID void.r
  RTHRES rthres.r
  INCREMENTS x.r y.r z.r
  NSTEP nx.i ny.i nz.i
  ONLYNEG
  NOCHK
  CUBE x0.r y0.r z0.r x1.r y1.r z1.r
  CUBE file1.xyz file2.xyz ...
  MOLMOTIF
  FRAGMENT file.xyz
  FRAGMENT
   x.r y.r z.r # (in angstrom!)
   ...
  ENDFRAGMENT/END
ENDNCIPLOT/END
~~~

The NCIPLOT keyword calculates the density ($$\rho({\bf r})$$) and the
reduced density gradient:
\begin{equation}
s({\bf r}) = \frac{\lvert{\bf \nabla}\rho({\bf r})\rvert}{2(3\pi^2)^{1/3}\rho({\bf r})^{4/3}}
\end{equation}
on a three-dimensional grid spanning the system or a certain
region of the system determined by the user. The density is assumed to
be the reference field (see the
[REFERENCE](/critic2/manual/fields/#c2-reference) keyword). If no
scalar fields have been loaded, then the promolecular density is used
instead. The reduced density gradient is calculated from the reference
fields using the formulas above.

The output of the NCIPLOT keyword is meant to be visualized with the
[vmd](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) program. As a result of
its operation, NCIPLOT generates the following files:

* `<root>.dat`: a text file containing two columns of numbers. The
  first column is the density multiplied by the sign of the second
  eigenvalue of the density Hessian. The second is the reduced density
  gradient. Each row corresponds to one point in the NCIPLOT grid.
  Plotting this data file directly (for instance, with gnuplot) gives
  the characteristic $s$ vs. $\rho$ plots seen in the literature.

* `<root>-dens.cube`: a cube containing the electron density times the
  sign of the second Hessian eigenvalue times 100.

* `<root>-grad.cube`: a cube containing the reduced density gradient
  (RDG).

* `<root>.vmd`: the VMD script for convenient visualization of the
  results. To use this file, open vmd from the same directory where
  the `.vmd` file resides. Then go to File->Load Visualization State
  and select the `.vmd` file.

The root of all the files generated by the NCIPLOT run can be changed
using the ONAME keyword in the NCIPLOT environment (default: the root
of the critic2 input file).

Worked out examples showing how to make NCIPLOTs in molecules,
surfaces, and crystals can be found in the [examples
pages](/critic2/examples/example_12_01_simple-nciplot/). This may be
an easier introduction to the use of the NCIPLOT keyword. The full set
of options is described below.

## Changing the Number of NCI Grid Points

By default, the region represented is the whole unit cell (in a solid)
or the whole molecule, with step lengths of 0.1 bohr in each
direction. The step lengths or the number of points in each axis can
be controlled with the INCREMENTS and NSTEP keywords. The INCREMENTS
keyword:
~~~
INCREMENTS x.r y.r z.r
~~~
accepts three arguments `x.r`, `y.r`, and `z.r`, which are
interpreted as the step lengths for the NCIPLOT grid in each
direction. The units are bohr (crystals) or angstrom (in
molecules). The NSTEP keyword:
~~~
NSTEP nx.i ny.i nz.i
~~~
accepts three integers corresponding to the number of steps in each
NCIPLOT grid direction.

## Selecting the Region for the NCI Plot

In medium or large molecules and crystals, representing the NCI
domains for the whole structure results in a very busy plot. In those
cases, it is recommended that the user focuses on the region of
interest and discards all the other domains. The simplest way to do
this is to restrict the NCIPLOT to a box encompassing the required
region:
~~~
CUBE x0.r y0.r z0.r x1.r y1.r z1.r
~~~
where (`x0.r` `y0.r` `z0.r`) and (`x1.r` `y1.r` `z1.r`) are the
coordinates corresponding to the two opposite corners that determine
the orthogonal box in which the NCI domains will be calculated. The
coordinates are in crystallographic (crystals) or in molecular
Cartesian coordinates (molecules, default unit: angstrom).
In crystals, a region larger than one periodic cell can also be
selected with the CUBE keyword.

Another option for restricting the NCI plot to a certain region
encompassing a number of intermolecular contacts is ues the box that
contains a number of fragments of the crystal or molecular structure
using:
~~~
CUBE file1.xyz file2.xyz ...
~~~
The box for the NCI grid will contain the fragments given by files
`file1.xyz`, `file2.xyz`,... in standard xyz format. A small border,
given by the RTHRES keyword, is added around the region exactly
containing all the atoms in all the xyz files. Note that, unlike in
the FRAGMENT keyword, the fragments passed to the CUBE keyword are not
used as fragments for the NCI calculation. They are simply used to
establish the box for the NCI grid.

## Cutoffs and Options for the Plot

Some cutoffs are relevant to the visualization of the NCI. The
`rhocut.r` and `dimcut.r` options of the CUTOFFS keyword:
~~~
CUTOFFS rhocut.r dimcut.r
~~~
determine how the density and reduced density gradient are written to
the `.dat` file (respectively). If, at a given point, the density is
above `rhocut.r` or the reduced density gradient is above `dimcut.r`,
then the point is not written to the `.dat` file. The defaults are:
`rhocut.r` = 0.2 and `dimcut.r` = 2.0 for densities from a loaded
scalar field and 1.0 for promolecular densities.

The cutoffs `rhoplot.r` and `dimplot.r` in the CUTPLOT keyword:
~~~
CUTPLOT rhoplot.r dimplot.r
~~~
can be used to change how (and whether) the NCI domains are
represented. When the density is greater than `rhoplot.r`, the reduced
density gradient at that point in the `-grad.cube` file is set to
a value of 100, effectively eliminating that point from the
isosurface plot. In addition, the default color scale represented in
RDG isosurfaces ranges from -`rhoplot.r` to `rhoplot.r`. The default
value is 0.05 (densities from a loaded scalar field) or 0.07
(promolecular). The `dimplot.r` value is the default isosurface value
represented by VMD. Default: 0.5 (loaded scalar field) or 0.3
(promolecular).

The SRHORANGE keyword:
~~~
SRHORANGE srhomin.r srhomax.r
~~~
is similar to CUTPLOT. When the density times the sign of the second
Hessian eigenvalue is greater than `srhomax.r` or smaller than
`srhomin.r`, the reduced density gradient in the `-grad.cube` file is
set to 100, effectively eliminating the point from the isosurface
plot. This is useful when plotting a subset of the peaks found in the
`.dat` file as isosurfaces. By default, no `srhomin.r` or `srhomax.r`
pruning is done.

The ONLYNEG keyword:
~~~
ONLYNEG
~~~
tells critic2 to represent only the points where the second eigenvalue
of the Hessian is negative.

In molecular crystals the MOLMOTIF keyword:
~~~
MOLMOTIF
~~~
is used to complete the molecules that lie across unit cell faces by
using atoms from neighboring cells. This results in a much more
understandable plot, since all molecules are wholly represented.

Finally, the VOID keyword:
~~~
VOID void.r
~~~
is used to represent only the points where the promolecular density is
lower than void.r.

## Checkpoint Files

By default, an NCI plot will create a checkpoint file with the same
name as the root for the run and extension `.chk_nci`. This checkpoint
is useful if several similar test runs need to be made, for instance,
using different cutoffs. To prevent critic2 from writing the
checkpoint file, use:
~~~
NOCHK
~~~
The NCIPLOT checkpoint file contains the promolecular densities for
the whole system and the fragments, the density, and the reduced
density gradient. If the checkpoint file exists and is compatible with
the current structure and fragments, it is read. Otherwise, it is
discarded and a new checkpoint is written. By default, checkpoint
files are used.

## NCI Domains Only Between Selected Fragments

In very large systems, the default NCI plots generated by critic2
contain all NCI domains. This results in a very busy plot and one
normally wants to focus on a specific intermolecular interaction.  In
the current version of NCIplot, it is possible to define molecular
fragments in order to focus on a specific interaction between two
fragments of the system. This can be done by using the FRAGMENT
environment:
~~~
FRAGMENT
 x.r y.r z.r # (in angstrom!)
 ...
ENDFRAGMENT/END
FRAGMENT file.xyz
~~~
Each FRAGMENT block or keyword defines one fragment. Only the
intermolecular interactions between fragments are represented (hence,
at least two FRAGMENT blocks are necessary). In the FRAGMENT
environment, the atomic positions of all the atoms in the fragment are
given. The `x.r`, `y.r`, `z.r` are Cartesian coordinates, and the
units are angstrom, regardless of the use of the
[UNITS](/critic2/manual/inputoutput/#c2-units) keyword. This is useful
in combination with the [WRITE](/critic2/manual/write/) keyword. In
the typical usage, WRITE generates an xyz file containing a portion
of the crystal or molecule. Then, the user removes all the undesired
atoms using a graphical program (like
[avogadro](https://avogadro.cc/)). Finally, the xyz of the desired
fragment are passed back to critic2 using the FRAGMENT keyword.
To simplify this process, the fragment can be read directly by
FRAGMENT from an xyz file (`file.xyz`). Note that the fragments need
not include all atoms in the crystal or molecule, or may contain
several lattice-translated copies of the same atom.

There are three options that control the behavior of the fragments:
RTHRES, RHOPARAM and RHOPARAM2. The RTHRES keyword is:
~~~
RTHRES rthres.r
~~~
When fragments are used, the density and reduced density gradient
grids are calculated inside a box encompassing the fragments, with an
additional border that is `rthres.r` thick. This value has units of
bohr in crystals, and angstrom in molecules. The default is 2.0
bohr. Note that RTHRES can also be used to control the border around
NCI regions defined with the CUBE keyword.

The RHOPARAM keyword:
~~~
RHOPARAM rhoparam.r
~~~
restricts the representation of NCI domains to those regions where
none of the fragments contributes more than `rhoparam.r` times to the
total promolecular density. The default is 0.95 (i.e. a 95%). This
keyword is useful to remove intramolecular domains within a fragment.

The RHOPARAM2 keyword:
~~~
RHOPARAM2 rhoparam2.r
~~~
is used to restrict the representation of NCI domains to the regions
where the sum of the promolecular density from all defined fragments
is higher than `rhoparam2.r` times the total promolecular density of
the whole system. The default is 0.75 (i.e. 75%). This keyword is
useful to remove NCI domains that are unrelated to the selected
fragments.

## Tips for Using NCIPLOT

Some tips for using the NCIPLOT keyword efficiently:

* If the reference field is a grid, the system is periodic (i.e. the
  structure was read with CRYSTAL) and no FRAGMENT keyword is used,
  the dimensions of the grids used in NCIPLOT are the same as the
  reference field.

* If the reference field that provides the density for NCIPLOT is a
  grid field, then it is usually much faster if core-augmentation
  (ZPSP field option) is not used. The reason is that if
  the core augmentation is not present, the reduced density gradient
  and the Hessian components are calculated by Fourier transform,
  leading to smoother derivatives.  However, not using the core
  augmentation can sometimes result in noisy Hessian components, which
  may result in alternate blue/red domains (because of a spurious
  change of sign caused by numerical inaccuracies).

* Older versions of VMD have problems dealing with non-orthogonal
  cells. There's little critic2 can do about this. To work around this
  problem, use the FRAGMENT or CUBE keywords so an orthogonal NCI
  region is used.
