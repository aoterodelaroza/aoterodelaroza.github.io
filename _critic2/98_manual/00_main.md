## Overview

Critic2 is a program for the analysis of results from quantum
mechanical calculation in molecules and periodic solids. It can read,
transform, and analyze structures, electron densities, and other
scalar fields generated by many quantum chemistry (and related)
programs, including WIEN2k, elk, PI, Quantum ESPRESSO, abinit, VASP,
DFTB+, Gaussian, psi4, siesta, cif, SHELX, and more. Critic2 provides
an abstraction layer that allows applying common analysis techniques
to the data (structures, electron densities, one-electron
wavefunctions) calculated by these programs, regardless of their
origin.

The original aim of critic2 was to implement the methods in Bader's
Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM). Some of critic2's basic
operations, for instance, include finding the critical points of a
scalar field (Bader's topology), or finding the attraction basins of
the maxima and integrating quantities in them (e.g. Bader's atomic
charges). In recent versions, however, critic2 has been extended to
support related operations, such as manipulating and interconverting
structural formats, perform arithmetic operations on scalar fields,
calculate related quantities like STM images, calculate NCI plots, and
many, many more.

Within the QTAIM framework, critic2 also provides a collection of
specialized algorithms: four different atomic basin integration
methods as well as a powerful and flexible automatic critical point
searching technique. Many scalar fields other than the electron
density are amenable to a QTAIM-style analysis (finding the topology
and integrating the attractor basins). These techniques (called
Quantum Chemical Topology, QCT, by P. Popelier) can be applied to a
variety of scalar fields including the ELF and the Laplacian of the
electron density. Critic2 can perform all these tasks for any field
either provided by the user or calculated inside the program.

Critic2 originally worked only with electron densities for periodic
crystals. Support for molecular structures and wavefunctions has been
added recently and it is reasonably complete. However, the performance
of critic2 in some tasks (e.g. molecular basin integrations) may not
be as good as programs that specialize in gas-phase molecules.  In
particular, you should be aware that critic2 treats all systems---both
crystals and molecules---as if they were periodically
repeated. Molecules are placed inside a very large repetition cell and
surrounded by a "no-go" zone, which is determined by the so-called
"molecular cell". In principle, this is not a problem (programs that
work with gas-phase molecules natively use a similar approach), but
oddities and bugs may be lurking.

Critic2 is described in

More details can be found in the README and INSTALL files included
with the criitc2 distribution. Information regarding the installation
of critic2 can be found [here](/critic2/installation/). A complete set
of examples is provided with the code (in the `examples/`
subdirectory) and in this website. The `examples.txt` file provides a
description of the examples.

## Command-Line Options and Usage {#c2-commandline}

Critic2 accepts a single input file (usually but not necessarily with
extension `.cri`). The command-line syntax is:
~~~
$ critic2 [-q] [-h] [-r /path/to/critic2] [file.cri [file.cro]]
~~~
If both input and output files are present, the output is redirected
to `file.cro`. Otherwise, it is written to standard output. If no
`file.cri` is present, the input is taken from standard input. The
input and output extensions (`cri` and `cro`) are not mandatory. This
is also valid:
~~~
$ critic2 < file.cri > file.cro
~~~
Alternatively, you can use critic2 interactively:
~~~
$ critic2
~~~
and enter the commands by hand.  The 
[rlwrap program](https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap) simplifies using critic2
interactively considerably by providing a history facility and
keyboard shortcuts. If you are using a linux distribution, you can
probably find rlwrap in your software repository. In addition,
depending on the tasks in the input file, auxiliary files may be
generated, usually with the same root as `file.cri` ("file", in this
case) or "stdin" if no input file is given.

The `-h` option ("help") prints a short help message and exits. The
`-q` option ("quiet") inhibits the initial and final messages. This is
useful when using critic2 in a pipe command. In addition, If no `-q`
is given, a copy of each input line read by critic2 is written to the
output, preceded by a "%%" prefix. This helps identify the different
parts of the output in long runs. The `-r` option tells critic2 where
to find its data files. If /path/to/critic2 is given, the data files
(wfc, dic, etc.) should be in /path/to/critic2/dat. Normally, the data
directory is located automatically by critic2 either at the
`--prefix` location indicated by the user during configuration or via
the `CRITIC_HOME` variable (see [Installation](/critic2/installation/)).

The input file usually start with a specification of the crystal or
molecular structure using the [CRYSTAL](/critic2/manual/crystal/)
or the [MOLECULE](/critic2/manual/molecule/) keywords. For
instance:
~~~
CRYSTAL file.struct
~~~
After the structure is read, one or more fields can be loaded using the
[LOAD](/critic2/manual/fields/#c2-load) keyword. For instance:
~~~
LOAD file.clmsum file.struct
~~~
Unless otherwise stated, the default distance units in critic2, both
in input and output, are atomic units (bohr) for crystals and angstrom
for molecules. This can be changed using the
[UNITS](/critic2/manual/inputoutput/#c2-units) keyword. Electron
densities are always in atomic units (electrons/bohr^3).

After reading the structure and loading the relevant fields, specific
keywords are used to perform the required tasks. For instance, 
[AUTO](/critic2/manual/cpsearch/#c2-auto)
(automatic determination of critical points), 
[INTEGRALS](/critic2/manual/integrate/#c2-integrals)
(atomic integration), 
[NCIPLOT](/critic2/manual/nciplot/)
(non-covalent interaction index plots), etc.  A concise description of
the critic2 keyword syntax is given in the `doc/syntax.txt` file and
in [this page](/critic2/syntax/). If you are
already familiar with critic2, that file will probably be more useful
to you than this guide.
