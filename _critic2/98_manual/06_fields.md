## Loading a field (LOAD) {#c2-load}

Scalar fields are loaded with the LOAD keyword. A number of different
field formats are supported:
~~~
LOAD file.cube
LOAD file.bincube
LOAD file_{DEN|PAWDEN|ELF|ELF|POT|VHA|VHXC|VXC|GDEN1|
           GDEN2|GDEN3|LDEN|KDEN}
LOAD [file.]{CHGCAR|AECCAR0|AECCAR2}
LOAD {[file.]CHG|[file.]ELFCAR}
LOAD file.qub
LOAD file.xsf
LOAD file.grid

LOAD AS CLM {ADD id1.s id2.s|SUB id1.s id2.s}
~~~
Critic2 loads scalar fields in "field slots": integer identifiers that
represent the field throughout the run. The NAME (or ID) keyword can
be used to assign a string identifier to a field as well, which is
useful in cases when many fields are loaded at the same time. At the
beginning of the run, field number 0 is the promolecular density,
which is automatically loaded right after the structure is succesfully
read. Successive LOAD commands assign field numbers in increasing
order: the first LOAD will create field number 1, the second LOAD will
be field number 2, and so on. By default, the first loaded field
(other than the promolecular density in slot 0) becomes the reference
field (see [REFERENCE](/critic2/manual/fields/#c2-reference)).

The simplest usage of load is:
~~~
LOAD file.ext
~~~
The scalar field information is read from `file.ext`. Critic2 uses the
extension to decide which format should be used for the reading:

* `.cube` for Gaussian cube files (grid field). Cube files can also be
  generated by programs other than Gaussian, for instance, Quantum
  ESPRESSO. They may correspond to a molecule or a periodic crysatl.

* Binary cube files (`.bincube`) contain the same information as cube
  files but use a binary format. They can be generated by critic2.

* `_DEN`, `_PAWDEN`, `_ELF`,... for abinit grids.

* `CHGCAR`, `AECCAR0`, `AECCAR2`, `CHG`, or `ELFCAR` for VASP grids.

* `.qub` for aimpac grids.

* `.xsf` for xcrysden grids.

* `.grid` for elk's grids (this requires a patch to elk, e-mail to
  request it).

* `.clmsum` for WIEN2k.

* `.RHO`, `.BADER`, `.DRHO`, `.LDOS`, `.VT`, and `.VH` for SIESTA's grids.

* `.OUT` for elk's STATE.OUT, ELF3D.OUT, RHO3D.OUT, etc.

* `.ion` for aiPI ion files.

* `.xml` for DFTB+'s `detailed.xml`.

* `.wfn`, `.wfx`, and `.fchk` for Gaussian wavefunction files.

* `.molden` for molecular wavefunction files (molden-style
  format). Both STO and GTO molecular wavefunctions are supported.

* `.pwc` for the electron density plus Kohn-Sham state information
  from Quantum ESPRESSO, generated using the pw2critic.x program in
  PP/. Optionally, one or two checkpoint files (`.chk`) from wannier90
  are read.

Specific details about each of these field types are given below.  In
some cases, the extension of the file to be loaded may be different
from the one that critic2 expects. For instance, WIEN2k creates files
with extensions other than clmsum for different fields (e.g. `.clmup`
for the spin-up density) but the same format. In those cases, the
keywords WIEN/ELK/... can be used to force critic2 to read a file with
a specific format.

### Cube files (cube, bincube)

Cube files can be generated by Gaussian's `cubegen` utility, but also
by other programs such as Quantum ESPRESSO. If the cube file
corresponds to a crystal structure, it is possible that it contains a
non-orthogonal grid (despite its name). Binary cube files (`.bincube`)
are created by critic2.

### Abinit density grids (DEN)

Density files generated by abinit come in a binary DEN format
(`file_DEN` or `file_PAWDEN`) and can be loaded by simply passing them
to LOAD. These files contain a grid of field values. Alternatively,
other files can be written using the "prt*" options in abinit,
containing different scalar fields in the same format, including the
electron localization function (prtelf, `_ELF` suffix), the Laplacian
of the electron density (prtlden, `_LDEN`), the exchange-correlation
potentiatl (prtvxc, `_VXC`), the kinetic energy density (usekden,
prtkden, `_KDEN`), the Hartree potential (prtvha, `_VHA`), the Hartree
plus xc potential (prtvhxc, `_VHXC`), and the total potential (prtpot,
`_POT`).

### VASP files (CHGCAR, AECCAR0, AECCAR2, CHG, ELFCAR)

VASP fields can come in two varieties. The `CHGCAR` and `AECCAR*`
files give grid values in a higher precision and multiplied by the
cell volume. These files can be read directly with LOAD. The other
format is the `CHG`, that is also used for the `ELFCAR` (containing
the values of the ELF function). In this case, the grid values are
given with less precision and they may or may not be multiplied by the
cell volume (depending on the VASP version). Both can be loaded with:
~~~
LOAD CHG
LOAD ELFCAR
~~~
If you have a file in this format that does not conform to those
names, you can use either the VASP (`CHGCAR`, `AECCAR*`) or the
VASPCHG (`CHG`,`ELFCAR`) keyword to force using one of the two formats:
~~~
LOAD VASP STRANGE_CHG_FILE_NAME.elfcar
LOAD VASPCHG STRANGE_CHG_FILE_NAME.chgcar
~~~
The `CHGCAR` files are relatively safe to use, but `CHG`s data points
may or may not be multiplied by the unit cell volume, and if you use
the latter you may have to tell critic2 which one it is. If you have a
CHG file that is multiplied by the volume, then you can force critic2
to load it in the same way as a CHGCAR with:
~~~
LOAD VASP CHG
~~~
I have never seen an ELFCAR that is multiplied by the volume, which
would not make much sense anyway. So the default behavior for ELFCAR
files is to assume that it is not.

### QE wavefunction plus Wannier checkpoint files (pwc) {#c2-qepwc}

The `.pwc` file format is generated by the pw2critic utility in the
post-processing (PP) package of Quantum ESPRESSO. The pwc file
contains the crystal structure, k-point and plane-wave information,
the Kohn-Sham state coefficients, as well as the various mappings
necessary to use them. A field loaded using a `.pwc` file corresponds
to the pseudo-valence density of the calculation, but the individual
Kohn-Sham states are read as well, which allows additional
calculations in critic2.

In particular, the LOAD command for the pwc file can be supplemented
with a second file (with extension `.chk`) generated by Wannier90 during
the calculation of the maximally localized Wannier functions of the
system. A field loaded in this way can be used in the [calculation of
delocalization indices in periodic systems](/critic2/manual/integrate/#c2-intwandi)
[^wandi]. An additional file also generated by wannier90
is necessary to provide the MLWF orbital rotations in spin-polarized
systems. In that case, the first checkpoint file comes from the
up-spin wannier90 calculation and the second checkpoint file from the
down-spin wannier90 calculation. See the FeO case in the dis_wannier
example.

### WIEN2k (clmsum, etc.)

In the case of WIEN2k, not all the necessary information is
encapsulated in the `.clmsum` (for instance, the muffin tin radii are
missing), so it is necessary to provide a second file: the `.struct`
file.

If the file extension is not `.clmsum` (e.g. `.clmup` or `.clmdn`),
you can force critic2 to use the WIEN2k interpreter by preceding the
file name with the keyword WIEN:
~~~
LOAD WIEN file.clmup
~~~
Some of these files (e.g. potentials) may have different
normalizations for the l=0 m=0 components in the muffins if they do
not represent electron densities (or spin densities). See RHONORM and
VNORM in the [additional options](/critic2/manual/fields/#c2-addload).

### Elk (STATE.OUT and other OUT files)

There are three ways of loading a scalar field generated by elk. If a
single `.OUT` file is passed to critic2, then it is assumed to be a
grid generated by `plot3d` (tasks 33, 43, 53, and 63). The loaded
scalar field will be a three-dimensional grid of values (i.e. the same
as a cube file).

If two `.OUT` files are passed to critic2, then it is assumed that the
first is the `STATE.OUT` and the second is the `GEOMETRY.OUT` for the
current elk calculation, and the scalar field will be calculated
analytically by evaluating the augmented plane-waves, same as in
WIEN2k. Similar to WIEN2k, elk's `STATE.OUT` is missing the structural
information required to calculate the electron density, which is why
the `GEOMETRY.OUT` is necessary.

Elk's `STATE.OUT` is version-dependent. The following versions of elk
have been tested and work with critic2: 4.0.15, 2.3.22, 2.3.16,
2.2.10, 2.2.9, 2.2.8, 2.2.5, 2.2.1, 2.1.25, 2.1.22, 1.4.22, 1.4.18,
1.4.5, 1.3.31, 1.3.30, 1.3.24, 1.3.22, 1.3.20, 1.3.15, 1.3.2, 1.2.20,
1.2.15, 1.1.4, 1.0.17, 1.0.16, and 1.0.0. If your version is not
supported (most likely because it is newer; I tend to check this part
of the code every aeon or so), please contact me.

Using a patched version of elk it is possible to generate other files
(`OTHER.OUT`) containing the spherical harmonics/plane waves
representation of other fields, such as the elf and the Coulomb
potential. See the tools/elk_mod directory for the patch source
files. When the `OTHER.OUT` (e.g. `ELF.OUT`) file is passed as the
third argument to the LOAD command, then that field is loaded instead
of the density.

### aiPI ion files (ion)

For aiPI inputs, several `.ion` files are necessary. The `.ion` files
can be associated to atoms either by using their non-equivalent atom
number (`nat1.i`) or the same atomic name as used in the crystal
structure specification (`at1.s`).

### DFTB+ files (xml file and others)

To load a field from the calcualted wavefunction using DFTB+, three
files are required: the `detailed.xml` file (written by the
`WriteDetailedXML` option), the `eigenvec.bin` file (using the
`WriteEigenVectors` options), and the file containing the wavefunction
coefficients, which has been provided by the authors of the DFTB+
package and can be [obtained online](http://www.dftb-plus.info/tools/waveplot).
The DFTB type is detected by the `.xml` extension of the first file
and, therefore, the name of these files need not be `detailed.xml` or
`eigenvec.bin`.

Two different types of systems can be run in DFTB+: crystals under
periodic boundary conditions, and molecules in the gas-phase. In the
first case, if using k-points other than Gamma, the wavefunction is
complex, and the evaluation of the density is relatively
slow. Molecules use real wavefunctions and they tend to be less
crowded than crystals, so using molecular DFTB fields should be
considerably faster.

### Gaussian wavefunction files (wfn/wfx)

Gaussian wavefunction files can be loaded by passing a `.wfn` or
`.wfx` file to critic2. This option is normally used in combination
with MOLECULE on the same file in order to obtain the same structure
from the isolated molcule. The evaluation of wfn/wfx densities and
their derivatives is analytical (no grids involved). If your file does
not have the wfn/wfx extension, you can force this format preceding
the file name with the WFN/WFX keyword.

A number of [field modifiers](/critic2/manual/arithmetics/#c2-arithbasic)
can be used with molecular wavefunction fields to select derivatives
of the electron density, a derivative field, or a particular molecular
orbital. For instance, if a wfn/wfx file is loaded in field 1, then
`$1:4` gives the value of molecular orbital number 4. Other labels
such as HOMO and LUMO are also available.

Supported wavefunction types: restricted (RHF), unrestricted (UHF),
and fractional occupation (MP2, etc.). Note that Gaussian wfn and wfx
files do not contain information about the virtual orbitals.

For molecular calculations that use effective core potentials (ECPs),
Gaussian provides the core density as a sum over atom-centered
Gaussian functions ("electron density functions" or EDFs). These
functions are only present in a usable form in a wfx file, but not in
the wfn format. Hence, densities for molecules containing ECPs will be
correct and contain the core contribution only if the wavefunction is
provided to critic2 using the wfx format. If a wfx file is not
available, core augmentation using critic2's internal density tables
is an option.

### Gaussian formatted checkpoint files (fchk)

Similar to wfn/wfx, formatted checkpoint files (`.fchk`) contain the
structure and molecular wavefunction information. They are generated
from a Gaussian checkpoint file (`.chk`) using the `formchk` utility. 
They should be used preferably in combination with a preceding
MOLECULE command on the same file. The calculation of the density and
related properties is analytical. 
[Field modifiers](/critic2/manual/arithmetics/#c2-arithbasic)
can be used to select particular molecular orbitals, same as in the
wfn/wfx case. If your file does not have a `.fchk` extension, you can
force this format by preceding the file name with the FCHK keyword.

Supported wavefunction types: restricted (RHF) and unrestricted
(UHF). 

Some parts of critic2 (the [MOLCALC](/critic2/manual/misc/#c2-molcalc)
keyword and orbital selection via
[field modifiers](/critic2/manual/arithmetics/#c2-arithbasic)
in arithmetic expressions) may use virtual orbitals if available. By
default critic2 will not read orbitals with zero occupation. The
virtual orbitals can be read by passing the READVIRTUAL keyword to
LOAD. This keyword only makes sense in formats that contain virtual
orbital information (fchk and molden).

### Molecular molden-style files (molden)

Similar to wfn/wfx, these files contain the molecular wavefunction
information. They should be used preferably in combination with a
preceding MOLECULE command on the same file. The calculation of the
density and related properties is analytical. 
[Field modifiers](/critic2/manual/arithmetics/#c2-arithbasic)
can be used to select particular molecular orbitals, same as in the
wfn/wfx case. If your file does not have the molden extension, you can
force this format preceding the file name with the MOLDEN keyword.

Molden files generated by different programs use slightly different
(and incompatible) versions of the same format, particularly regarding
normalization of the primitives. Recent versions of psi4 (~2016) have
been tested. ADF wavefunctions in terms of STO basis functions are
also supported (tested in 2017). If you try molden files from any
other program, please let me know how it goes so I can update this
manual.

Supported wavefunction types: restricted (RHF) and unrestricted (UHF),
both with STO and GTO primitives. Virtual orbitals can be read using
the READVIRTUAL keyword.

Some parts of critic2 (the [MOLCALC](/critic2/manual/misc/#c2-molcalc)
keyword and orbital selection via
[field modifiers](/critic2/manual/arithmetics/#c2-arithbasic)
in arithmetic expressions) may use virtual orbitals if available. By
default critic2 will not read orbitals with zero occupation. The
virtual orbitals can be read by passing the READVIRTUAL keyword to
LOAD. This keyword only makes sense in formats that contain virtual
orbital information (fchk and molden).

### Making copies of a field

The LOAD COPY keyword can be used to make a copy of the field `id.s`
to the next available slot, or to `id2.s` if it is given with the
keyword TO.

### Loading the promolecular density

The keyword PROMOLECULAR is used to load a promolecular density field
(same as field number 0). If a finite fragment of the crystal is
passed to LOAD PROMOLECULAR as an xyz file (`file.xyz`) using the
optional FRAGMENT keyword, then the sum of atomic densities is built
using only the atoms in that fragment.

## Additional LOAD options {#c2-addload}

The definition of a field can be supplemented by additional optional
keywords that control its behavior. The additional options are passed
to LOAD after the file name. The list of options follows.

~~~
NEAREST|TRILINEAR|TRISPLINE|TRICUBIC
~~~
Choose the grid interpolation mode in a grid field. NEAREST, use the
field at the nearest grid point (zero first and second
derivatives). TRILINEAR, trilinear interpolation (zero second
derivatives). TRISPLINE, 3d-spline interpolation (adapted from the
abinit code, this part was coded by A. Lherbier according to the
source). If some derivatives are not available (first and second in
NEAREST, second in TRISPLINE), they are taken as zero. TRICUBIC,
tricubic interpolation using local information, see 
[Lekien and Marsden, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng., 63 (2005) 455-471.](https://doi.org/10.1002/nme.1296)

By default, TRICUBIC is used. TRISPLINE may require a lot of memory in
very large cube files (say, 400^3 or larger). However, the memory
allocation for the TRISPLINE interpolation only happens if the parts
of critic2 that require derivatives or interpolation at points outside
of the grid are called. If only grid-based algorithms (e.g. YT, BADER,
NCIPLOT with default NSTEP,...) are used then no additional memory is
used.

(Applies to: grids. Default: TRICUBIC.)

~~~
CORE|NOCORE
~~~
The electron density from a pseudopotential/plane-waves calculation,
given on a grid, only represents valence electrons. In order to get an
approximation to the all-electron density, it can be augmented by
summing the corresponding core contributions to the electron density
at the atomic sites. The [ZPSP](/critic2/manual/crystal/#c2-charge)
keyword is used to determine how many
electrons are added by each core. The CORE keyword activates the use
of core augmentation for this field. Most of the time, this procedure
is not entirely satisfactory, and is best avoided if possible (e.g. by
writing the all-electron density using the PAW transformation, if PAW
is being used).

Applies to: grids, although it can be used with any other
field. Default: NOCORE. Note that for grid fields read with LOAD,
the pseudopotential charges (ZPSP) are not set, so even if CORE is
active, critic2 does not know how many core electrons to add. ZPSP
values are required.

~~~
EXACT|APPROXIMATE
~~~
The calculation of the electron density in aiPI and DFTB+ fields is
relatively expensive. Using the APPROXIMATE keyword, the atomic
contributions to the density are calculated by interpolating from a
radial grid, that is precomputed at the beginning of the run. EXACT
calculates the fully analytical values of the field with no
approximations.

Applies to: PI and DFTB+ fields. Default: APPROXIMATE.

~~~
RHONORM|VNORM
~~~
In WIEN2k, the clmsum and other files representing the electron
density come in two different normalizations: The l=0 m=0 radial
component may or may not divided by $$\sqrt{4\pi}$$.  RHONORM = use the
same normalization as the density (divided by $$\sqrt{4\pi}$$). VNORM
= use the same normalization as the potentials (no division).

Applies to: WIEN2k. Default: RHONORM.

~~~
NOTESTMT
~~~
Augmented plane-wave scalar fields (WIEN2k and elk) are checked by
default for discontinuities on the muffin tin surface, which can
affect the location of critical points and the tracing of gradient
paths through the muffin tin surface. This test may take some time if
the number of atoms in the system is large. NOTESTMT skips the
discontinuity test.

Applies to: WIEN2k and elk. Default: test the muffin tin
discontinuity.

~~~
ANALYTICAL/NUMERICAL
~~~
NUMERICAL = Calculate the derivatives of the field
numerically. ANALYTICAL = calculate the derivatives of the field
analytically. Mostly used for testing the implementation of new field
types.

Applies to: all. Default: ANALYTICAL.

~~~
TYPNUC {-3,3}
~~~
Controls whether the nuclei are maxima (-3) or minima (3) of the
field.

Applies to: all. Default: -3 (maxima).

~~~
NORMALIZE n.r
~~~
Normalize the grid integral over the unit cell to `n.r`. In the case
of an electron density, `n.r` is the number of electrons per cell.

Applies to: grids.

~~~
{NAME|ID} id.s
~~~
Name the field using a string identifier. The identifier can be used
in place of the field number in any expression (e.g. `$name` instead
of `$1`). The label for this field will written in the part of
the output describing the field. The string should be a single
word containing letters and numbers. You can list all available field
identifiers using the
[LIST](/critic2/manual/arithmetics/#c2-list) keyword.

~~~
ZPSP at1.s q1.r...
~~~
Set the pseudopotential charges for this particular field. Note that
setting these charges does not activate core augmentation (you need CORE as
well). The global [ZPSP](/critic2/manual/crystal/#c2-charge) keyword
can be used to set the ZPSP for all fields.

## Field arithmetics

New fields can be defined as combinations of the existing ones using
the LOAD AS keyword. This allows the creation of fields that are not
directly computed by the electronic structure program, and is very
useful in combination with the
[CUBE](/critic2/manual/graphics/#c2-cube) keyword to calculate and
visualize new grids. For instance, if `rhoup.cube` and `rhodn.cube`
are the spin-up and spin-down densities, it is possible to get the
total density and the spin density using:
~~~
LOAD rhoup.cube
LOAD rhodn.cube
LOAD AS "$1+$2"
LOAD AS "$1-$2"
~~~
The spin-up density is loaded as field `1`, rhodn.cube is field `2`,
field `3` is the sum of both and field `4` is the spin density,
which can, for instance, be graphically represented or integrated in
the atomic basins to get the atomic magnetic moments (see the
[INTEGRABLE](/critic2/manual/integrate/#c2-integrable) keyword).

The list of arithmetic operations that can be performed on fields is
[quite large](/critic2/manual/arithmetics/). If no additional keywords
are present between LOAD AS and the arithmetic expression (like LAP,
GRAD, or CLM, see below), then the resulting new field can be of two
types. If the arithmetic expression involves at least one grid, the
resulting field will be a grid with the same number of points. If more
than one grid appears in the expression, then the new grid size is the
maximum of the number of points in every dimension.

If the expression contains no grid fields, then the resulting field is
a "ghost field". A ghost field is just an arithmetic expression that
is parsed and processed every time the field is evaluated. The
analyitcal derivatives for a ghost field are not available, so the
[NUMERICAL](/critic2/manual/fields/#c2-addload) option is the default
for this kind of field.

Regardless of the types of fields in the expression passed to LOAD AS,
a grid field can be enforced by explicitly specifying the size of the
grid, either by giving the number of points in each direction (`n1.i`,
`n2.i`, `n3.i`) or by adopting the size of another grid (SIZEOF, the
grid used as mold is field `id.s`). If grid fields appear in the
expression but you still want a ghost field, then use the GHOST
keyword.

The PROMOLECULAR option to LOAD AS allows the creation of a grid out
of the promolecular density, with `n1.i`, `n2.i`, `n3.i` points in
each direction. Alternatively, the size of grid field `id.s` can be
used with the SIZEOF keyword. Similarly, CORE creates a grid using
only the core densities, as specified by the ZPSPs of the atoms. If a
fragment of the crystal is passed as an xyz file to any of those
keywords (with the optional FRAGMENT keyword), then only the atoms in
the fragment contribute to the sum of atomic (or core) densities.

The LAP, GRAD, POT, and CLM keywords of LOAD AS apply only to specific
types of fields:

* GRAD and POT only apply to grid fields. GRAD defines a new grid as
  the norm of the gradient of the grid field id.s. POT is the
  electrostatic (Hartree) potential generated by the density in field
  `id.s`. Both are calculated using a Fourier transform to and from
  reciprocal space. In the case of POT, the resulting potential is in
  Hartree by default (i.e. with a $$4\pi$$ pre-factor in Poisson's
  equation). The units can be changed to Rydberg ($$8*\pi$$ factor) by
  using the RY or RYDBERG keyword.

* LAP applies to grid, WIEN2K, and elk fields. In all cases, the
  keyword creates a field of the same type containing the Laplacian of
  the field `id.s`. If `id.s` is a grid, the Laplacian is calculated
  by Fourier transform. If it is a WIEN2k or elk field, the Laplacian
  is calculated analytically both inside the muffin tins and in the
  interstitial using the appropriate transformation.

* CLM defines a new field as the addition (`id1.s`+`id2.s`) or
  substraction (`id1.s`-`id2.s`) of fields of the WIEN2K or elk type
  by using the ADD and SUB keywords respectively. Note that the muffin
  tin radii, number of plane-waves, etc. have to be the same for both
  source fields.

## Changing the field options after LOAD (SETFIELD) {#c2-setfield}

The options of a given field can be changed anywhere in the input
after it has been loaded using the SETFIELD keyword:
~~~
SETFIELD {id.s} [NEAREST|TRILINEAR|TRISPLINE|TRICUBIC] 
   [EXACT|APPROXIMATE] [RHONORM|VNORM] [CORE|NOCORE] 
   [NUMERICAL|ANALYTICAL] [TYPNUC {-3,-1,1,3}] 
   [NORMALIZE n.r] [ZPSP at1.s q1.r...]
~~~
SETFIELD changes the properties of field with identifier `id.s`. The
keywords have the same meaning as above.

## Unloading a field (UNLOAD) {#c2-unload}

~~~
UNLOAD {id.s|ALL}
~~~
The UNLOAD keyword unloads the field `id.s` or all fields (ALL).

## The reference field (REFERENCE) {#c2-reference}

One of the loaded fields is chosen as the **reference field**. The
reference field is used as the primary field in all computations. For
instance, when [BASINPLOT](/critic2/manual/basinplot/#c2-basinplot)
is used, the basins of the reference field
are plotted. If one uses an integration method 
([INTEGRALS](/critic2/manual/integrate/#c2-integrals), 
[QTREE](/critic2/manual/integrate/#c2-qtree),
[YT](/critic2/manual/integrate/#c2-yt),
[BADER](/critic2/manual/integrate/#c2-bader)), the reference field
provides the attraction basins in which other scalar fields are
integrated. If
[AUTO](/critic2/manual/cpsearch/#c2-auto) is used, the critical points
of the reference field are found. And so on.

The first field loaded becomes the reference field. If no fields have
been loaded, then the reference is the promolecular density (field `0`
or `rho0`). In order to change the reference field, the REFERENCE
keyword can be used:
~~~
REFERENCE id.s
~~~
REFERENCE sets field `id.s` as reference.

## Typical output for the LOAD keyword

The output when loading a field is composed of two parts: a first
part containing information particular to the type of field loaded,
and a second part containing the field flags.

For instance, loading a cube file (or any grid) gives an output whose
first part looks like this:
~~~
+ Field number 1
  Source: urea.rho.cube
  Type: grid
  Grid dimensions : 81  81  72
  First elements... 1.084595807000E-03  1.081705980000E-03  1.085704517000E-03
  Last elements... 1.121839312000E-03  1.114200414000E-03  1.106977600000E-03
  Sum of elements... 2.316327381350E+04
  Sum of squares of elements... 6.142727758913E+03
  Cell integral (grid SUM) = 47.99979210
  Min: 3.81287906E-04
  Average: 4.90340095E-02
  Max: 1.01178629E+00
  Interpolation mode (1=nearest,2=linear,3=spline,4=tricubic): 4
~~~
The output for the other grid file formats (abinit DEN, VASP, qub,
xsf, grid, SIESTA) is essentially the same.  This output gives the
field integer identifier (`1` in this case), the source file, the 
type of field (grid), and a number of information specific to grid
fields. This includes the number of points on the grid (`grid
dimensions`), the first and last three elements, and the sum and
sum of the squares of the elements. The `Cell integral` line is
particularly important because it gives the integral of the grid field
over the unit cell (i.e. $$\frac{(\sum_i f_i) V}{N}$$ with
$$V$$ the unit cell volume and $$N$$ the total number of grid points).
If the grid field represents the electron density, it will
approximately sum to the number of electrons in the cell (in the example
above, 48). The output also provides the minimum, maximum, and average
field value on the grid, and the chosen interpolation mode.

The second part of the output is common to all fields:
~~~
  Use core densities? F
  Numerical derivatives? F
  Nuclear CP signature: -3
  Number of non-equivalent critical points: 5
  Number of critical points in the unit cell: 16
  Alias for this field (1): $1
~~~
It contains the field flags: whether core densities are being used, if
derivatives are calculated numerically or analytically, and the signature of the
nuclear critical points. In addition, it also gives the number of
critical points found for this particular field. Since we just loaded
it, the number of critical 
points is the same as the number of atoms (which are always considered
critical points). Finally, the output lists the aliases that can be
used in arithmetic expressions to refer to this field.

For WIEN2k and elk fields, the first part of the output contains:
~~~
+ Field number 2
  Source: srtio3.clmsum
  Type: wien2k
  Complex?: F
  Spherical harmonics expansion LMmax: 6
  Max. points in radial grid: 781
  Total number of plane waves (new/orig): 350/3119
  Density-style normalization? T
~~~
The APW-specific information includes, whether the field contains
complex coefficients in the expansions (it does if the crystal
structure is not centrosymmetric), the maximum L for the spherical
harmonics expansion inside the muffin tins, the number of radial
points inside the muffin tins, the cutoff for discarding negligible
plane-wave contributions in the interstitial, and the number of
plane-waves remaining after pruning. 

In the case of WIEN2k and elk fields, the muffin tins are tested for
discontinuities:
~~~
* Muffin-tin discontinuity test
  Atom: 1 rmt= 1.8000000 RMS/max/min(fout-fin) = 0.000420  0.001878  -0.000006
  Atom: 2 rmt= 1.8000000 RMS/max/min(fout-fin) = 0.000116  0.000473  0.000006
  Atom: 3 rmt= 1.8000000 RMS/max/min(fout-fin) = 0.000314  0.002103  -0.000059
  Atom: 4 rmt= 1.8000000 RMS/max/min(fout-fin) = 0.000087  0.000410  -0.000006
  Atom: 5 rmt= 1.8000000 RMS/max/min(fout-fin) = 0.000738  0.005342  -0.000313
+ Assert - no spurious CPs on the muffin tin surface: T
~~~
This system has five muffin tins, all of them with 1.8 bohr
radius. The test determines whether the discontinuity at the muffin
flips the sign of the radial gradient of the field, which would create
spurious critical points. In this case, the field passes the test,
which means it can be used without problem in 
[AUTO](/critic2/manual/cpsearch/#c2-auto) or 
[GRDVEC](/critic2/manual/gradientpath/#c2-grdvec). The [NOTESTMT](/critic2/manual/fields/#c2-addload)
field option can be used to skip this test.

A typical LOAD output for molecular wavefunctions is:
~~~
+ Field number 3
  Source: benzene.wfx
  Type: molecular wavefunction
  Wavefunction type: restricted
  Number of MOs (total): 21
  Number of MOs (occupied): 21
  Number of primitives (GTO): 216
  Number of EDFs: 0
  Basis set data NOT available
~~~
It contains the type of wavefunction (restricted closed-shell in this
case), the number of molecular orbitals, number of primitives, and
number of EDFs (in case the calculation used ECPs). In fields loaded
from a fchk and if critic2 is compiled with the
[libcint library](/critic2/libraries/#c2-libcint), the basis set data
will be avilable for molecular integrals with the 
[MOLCALC](/critic2/manual/misc/#c2-molcalc) keyword.

Other field types contain specific information for their types, which
is usually self-explanatory. If the LOAD keyword is the first in the
run, then the field becomes reference, which will be shown in the
output:
~~~
* Field number 1 is now REFERENCE.
~~~
See the [REFERENCE](/critic2/manual/fields/#c2-reference)
keyword for more information.

## Typical output for the REFERENCE keyword

The output of the REFERENCE keyword is relatively simple. First, the
field set as reference is given:
~~~
* Field number 2 is now REFERENCE.
~~~
Then, the output shows the list of the integrable properties.
~~~
* List of integrable properties (3)
#  Id  Type  Field  Name
    1   v        0  Volume  
    2  fval      2  Pop  
    3  lval      2  Lap  
~~~
This is the list of quantities that will be integrated by the basin
integration methods like
[INTEGRALS](/critic2/manual/integrate/#c2-integrals) or
[YT](/critic2/manual/integrate/#c2-yt).
Chaning the reference field resets the integrable properties
list to its default value, which is to integrate the
basin volumes, the reference field, and the Laplacian of the reference
field. If the reference field is an electron density, then the last
two correspond to the atomic electron population and the electron
density Laplacian. The list of integrable properties can be modified
with the [INTEGRABLE](/critic2/manual/integrate/#c2-integrable)
keyword.

Finally, critic2 lists the known critical points for this field:
~~~
* Summary of critical points for the reference field
  Non-equivalent critical points = 16
  Cell critical points = 52
  Topological class (n|b|r|c): 5(16) 6(22) 3(10) 2(4) 
  Morse sum: 0
~~~
If a critical point search has not been conducted, then the summary
will include only the atoms as critical points.
