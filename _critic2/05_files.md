This is the list of the relevant files and directories in the critic2
package:

* `README`: some basic instructions for installing and using the
  program.
* `AUTHORS`: the authors of the package.
* `LICENSE`: a copy of the licence. Critic2 is distributed under the
  GNU/GPL license v3.
* `INSTALL`: installation instructions. These are automatically
  generated by autoconf.
* `THANKS`: acknowledgements to various people that contributed code
  or external libraries.
* `src/`: source code. The critic2 binary is generated in here.
* `doc/`: manual (`user-guide.txt`) and keyword reference (`syntax.txt`). You
  can compile a PDF copy of the manual with `compile.sh` (rst2latex required).
* `dat/`: atomic density, cif database, and other data. These need to be
  accessible to critic2 at runtime (either by configuring with the
  `prefix` option or setting the `CRITIC_HOME` environment variable,
  see [Installation](/critic2/installation/).
* `examples/`: examples showing how to use critic2. See
  `examples/examples.txt` for more information.
