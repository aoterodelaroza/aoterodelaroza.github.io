## Installation Instructions

To build critic2, you will need:

* A [relatively modern](#whichcompilerswork) Fortran compiler.

* A C compiler.

* The [cmake](#c2-usecmake) build system.

* The make program.

* Optionally, a few [additional libraries](#c2-libraries).

These tools may already be available on your machine but, if they are
not, they can be typically installed using a software package
manager (`apt`, `rpm`, etc. on Linux; [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS).

### Build Using cmake {#c2-usecmake}

Using cmake is the recommended installation procedure, and the only
way to build critic2 in recent versions. Change to the critic2 root
directory and make a subdirectory for the compilation:
~~~
mkdir build
cd build
~~~
Then do:
~~~
cmake ..
~~~
There are a number of compilation options that can be passed to cmake,
the most relevant of which is `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=prefix`, which
sets the installation directory. You can tweak this and other
compilation options using one of the multiple cmake interfaces, like
ccmake (use `ccmake ..` from the `build` directory). To build the
program, do:
~~~
make
~~~
You can use `make -j n` to use `n` cores for the compilation. Running
make creates the `critic2` binary in `build/src/`.

Some build options for advanced users: If you need to compile a static
version of critic2, use:
~~~
cmake .. -DBUILD_STATIC=ON
~~~
The binary generated using this option can be copied to a different
computer (with the same architecture), even if it does not have the
compiler libraries, but you will need static versions of all the
libraries (with extension `.a`) for the static build to work.
To compile a version with debug flags,
~~~
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
~~~
This version gives more informative errors when the program crashes,
but it is slower.

### Build Using configure/make {#c2-useconfigure}

**These instructions only apply to old versions of critic2; the
configure/make build system has been removed from the development
version.** You need to run:
~~~
autoreconf
~~~
Prepare for compilation by doing:
~~~
./configure
~~~
Use `configure --help` for information about the different
compilation options. The `--prefix` option to `configure` sets the
installation path. More details about `configure` can be found in the
`INSTALL` file included in the distribution. Once critic2 is configured,
compile the program using:
~~~
make
~~~
This should create the critic2 executable inside the `src/`
subdirectory.

### Installing and Setting up the Environment

Critic2 can be installed to the `prefix` directory by doing:
~~~
make install
~~~
However, the binary can be used directly from the source directory by
setting the `CRITIC_HOME` environment variable. It must point to the
root directory of the distribution:
~~~
export CRITIC_HOME=/home/alberto/programs/critic2
~~~
This variable is necessary for critic2 to find the atomic densities
and other files. These files should be in `${CRITIC_HOME}/dat/`.

Critic2 is parallelized with OpenMP for shared-memory architectures
(unless disabled during compilation). You change the number of
parallel threads by setting the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment
variable.

## Which Compilers Work? {#whichcompilerswork}

Critic2 uses some features from the more modern Fortran standards,
which may not be available in some older compilers. In consequence,
not all compilers may be able to generate the binary and, even if they
do, the binary may be broken. Two versions of critic2 are
distributed. The **development** version, corresponding to the master
branch of the repository, and the **stable** version, in the stable
branch. Only patches addressing serious bugs will be introduced in the
stable version; all new development happens in the development
version. The stable version is compilable with all versions of
gfortran starting at 4.9. All Intel fortran compiler versions from
2011 onwards also compile the stable code.

The development version can be compiled with gfortran-6 and later and
with Intel fortran 2019 and later, although some recent versions of
Intel fortran may cause problems if aggressive optimization is
used. All other compilers tested have issues, and fail to produce a
working binary. This is the list of compilers tested:

* gfortran 4.8: critic2 cannot be compiled because allocatable
  components in user-defined types are not supported in this and older
  versions.
* gfortran 4.9 through 5.4 (and possibly older and newer gfortran-5):
  the code compiles correctly but there are errors allocating and
  deallocating the global field array (`sy%f`) and other complex
  user-defined types. The program is usable, but problems will arise
  if more than one crystal structure or more than 10 scalar fields are
  loaded.
* gfortran 6.x and above: no errors.
* ifort, all versions from 12.1 up to 18.0.3: catastrophic internal
  compiler errors of unknown origin.
* ifort, version 2019.0.3.199: it compiles but inexplicable segmentation
  faults with nonsensical tracebacks are thrown when using YT or
  BADER and when loading and unloading fields.
* ifort, version 2019.0.5.281: if aggressive optimization is used (`-O2`
  and `-O3` flags), the compiler may freeze while compiling
  `systemmod@proc.f90`.
* Portland Group Fortran compiler (pgfortran), version 17.3. There are
  two important compiler problems: i) passing subroutines and
  functions whose interface includes multidimensional arrays as
  arguments or function results does not work, and ii) internal
  compiler error when compiling meshmod.f90.

In summary: **Only recent versions of gfortran and ifort are
guaranteed to work with the development version. If you cannot use
gfortran 6 or newer or ifort 2019 or newer, download the stable
version.** I do not think this is because of errors in the critic2
code (though if you find that it is, please let me know). If your
compiler throws an internal compiler error while trying to build
critic2, you may want to consider submitting a bug report to the
compiler developers.

You can choose the compiler by setting the FC and CC environment
variables to the path of your preferred compiler and then building in
the usual way:
~~~
export FC=/usr/bin/gfortran-6 CC=/usr/bin/gcc-6
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
~~~
Once cmake generates the cache variables, the variables need not be
set again, unless you delete the build directory.

## External Libraries {#c2-libraries}

### Readline {#c2-readline}

When critic2 is built using cmake, it is possible to link against the
readline library. This library enables shell-like features for
critic2's command line interface such as keyboard shortcuts, history,
and autocompletion. On linux, you can typically find it in the
repository of your chosen distribution.

### NLOPT {#c2-nlopt}

[NLOPT](https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt) is a library implementing
many local and global optimization algorithms. This library is used by
the [COMPAREVC](/critic2/manual/structure/#c2-comparevc) keyword,
which compares either two crystal structures or a structure and a
diffraction patterns allowing for cell deformations. On linux, you can
typically find it in the repository of your chosen distribution. To
use a non-standard installation directory, make the
`NLOPT_INCLUDE_DIRS` variable point to the NLOPT include directory
(where the `nlopt.f` file can be found) and `NLOPT_LIBRARIES` point to
the location of the shared library:
~~~
cmake -DNLOPT_INCLUDE_DIRS=/usr/include/ \
      -DNLOPT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnlopt.so ..
~~~

### Libxc {#c2-libxc}

[Libxc](https://gitlab.com/libxc/libxc) is a library that implements
exchange-correlation energies and potentials for many semilocal
functionals (LDA, GGA and meta-GGA). In critic2, it is used to
calculate exchange and correlation energy densities via de `xc()`
arithmetic expressions. Critic2 is not compatible with
versions of libxc older than 5.0.

If you compile using cmake, libxc should be found automatically by the
build system if it installed in a standard location. Otherwise, you
can indicate the location of the include directory with the
`LIBXC_INCLUDE_DIRS` variable and the location of the `libxc.so` and
`libxcf03.so` with the `LIBXC_xc_LIBRARY` and `LIBXC_xcf03_LIBRARY`
variables, respectively. For instance:
~~~
cmake -DLIBXC_INCLUDE_DIRS=/usr/include \
      -DLIBXC_xc_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxc.so \
      -DLIBXC_xcf03_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcf03.so ..
~~~

The libxc library is used in critic2 to create new scalar fields from
the exchange and correlation energy density definitions in the library
using a density, gradient, or kinetic energy density already available
to critic2 as a scalar field. See the
[manual](/critic2/manual/arithmetics/#libxc) for more information.

### Libcint {#c2-libcint}

[Libcint](https://github.com/sunqm/libcint) is a library for
calculating molecular integrals between Gaussian-Type Orbitals
(GTOs). In critic2, this library is used mostly for testing but some
options to the `MOLCALC` keyword and some functions in arithmetic
expressions require it (e.g. the molecular electrostatic potential, `mep`).

To build critic2 with libcint support, you need to indicate the
directory where the include directory (`LIBCINT_INCLUDE_DIRS`) and the
location of the library file (`LIBCINT_LIBRARY`). For instance:
~~~
cmake -DLIBCINT_INCLUDE_DIRS=/home/alberto/git/libcint/build/include/ \
      -DLIBCINT_LIBRARY=/home/alberto/git/libcint/build/libcint.a ..
~~~
The shared library (`libcint.so`) can be also used.

See the [chemical
functions](/critic2/manual/arithmetics/#availchemfun) and the
[MOLCALC](/critic2/manual/misc/#c2-molcalc) sections of the manual for
usage.
