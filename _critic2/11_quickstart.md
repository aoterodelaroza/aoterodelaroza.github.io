Critic2 reads the user commands from a single input file (the `.cri`
file). A simple input is:
~~~
crystal cubicBN.cube
load cubicBN.cube
yt
~~~
which reads the crystal structure from a cube file, then the electron
density from the same cube file, and then calculates the atomic
charges and volumes using the YT method. Run critic2 as:
~~~
critic2 cubicBN.cri
~~~
This will write to the standard output. Redirect the output to a file
with either of:
~~~
critic2 cubicBN.cri > cubicBN.cro
critic2 cubicBN.cri cubicBN.cro
~~~
Finally, you can just open critic2 and type commands by hand:
~~~
critic2
$ ...
~~~
If you do this, check out the 
[rlwrap program](https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap), which 
will make the interactive usage of critic2 much easier:
~~~
rlwrap critic2
~~~

A detailed description of the keywords accepted by critic2 is given in
the [user's guide](/critic2/manual/) and a list of commands in the
[syntax.txt file](/critic2/syntax/).  The user's guide is in the
`doc/` directory of the critic2 distribution in plain text format
(`user-guide.txt`). A copy of the manual in PDF format
(`user-guide.pdf`) can be generated by running the compile.sh
script. This requires a working LaTeX installation, the rst2latex
program (included in the docutils package), and awk. Several examples
are provided in the `examples/` subdirectory.
