Critic2 reads a single input file (the cri file). A simple input is:
~~~
crystal cubicBN.cube
load cubicBN.cube
yt
~~~
which reads the crystal structure from a cube file, then the electron
density from the same cube file, and then calculates the atomic
charges and volumes using the YT method. Run critic2 as:
~~~
critic2 cubicBN.cri
~~~
This will write to the standard output. Redirect the output to a file
with either of:
~~~
critic2 cubicBN.cri > cubicBN.cro
critic2 cubicBN.cri cubicBN.cro
~~~
Finally, you can just open critic2 and type commands by hand:
~~~
critic2
$ ...
~~~
If you do this, check out the 
[rlwrap program](https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap), which 
will make the interactive usage of critic2 much easier. 

A detailed description of the keywords accepted by critic2 is given in
the user's guide and a short reference in the syntax.txt file. 
The user's guide is in the doc/ directory in plain text format
(user-guide.txt). A copy of the manual in PDF format (user-guide.pdf)
can be generated by running the compile.sh script. This requires a
working LaTeX installation, the rst2latex program (included in the
docutils package), and awk. A concise summary of the syntax can be
found in the syntax.txt file. Several examples are provided in the
examples/ subdirectory.
