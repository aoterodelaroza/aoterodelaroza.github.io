Critic2 can read structures and scalar fields from multiple
sources. The amount of information available to critic2 depends on the
source file. The table below gives the computational chemistry
software with which critic2 can interface, listed in alphabetical
order.

The file format is assumed by critic2 based on the extension (although
there are keywords to change this behavior). The table gives in the
second column the extensions critic2 uses for each format. When the
same extension is used for different formats, critic2 will try to
guess the correct format from the contents of the file.

The "structures" column gives whether the structure of a molecule, a
crystal, or both can be read from the file. A crystal structure must
be read with the [CRYSTAL](/critic2/manual/crystal/#c2-crystal)
keyword and a molecule with the
[MOLECULE](/critic2/manual/molecule/#c2-molecule) keyword.

The "fields" column gives the information read by critic2 when this
file is read as a new scalar field using the [LOAD](/critic2/manual/fields/#c2-load)
keyword. In this column, "grid" means that the field is available only
at the points belonging to a uniform grid, and that the value
calculated at any other point is obtained by
interpolation. "arbitrary" means that the scalar field read
corresponds to whatever the program generated; critic2 will make no
assumptions. "rho" means that the electron density is read, and "wfn"
means that the wavefunction is read. The latter typically allows
calculating values of individual molecular orbitals, energy densities,
and other quantities. "basis" means that the basis set is read, which
enables the calculation of molecular integrals.

More details about these formats can be found in the documentation for
the [CRYSTAL](/critic2/manual/crystal/#c2-crystal),
[MOLECULE](/critic2/manual/molecule/#c2-molecule), and
[LOAD](/critic2/manual/fields/#c2-load) keywords.
