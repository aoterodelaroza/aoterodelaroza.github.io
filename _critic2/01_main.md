Critic2 is a program for the analysis of quantum mechanical
calculation results in molecules and periodic solids.

* The **development version** works only with recent compilers (see
  [here](/critic2/installation/#whichcompilerswork)) but has the latest features.\\
  Version **1.0**: 
  [critic2-1.0dev.zip](https://github.com/aoterodelaroza/critic2/archive/1.0dev.zip),
  [critic2-1.0dev.tar.gz](https://github.com/aoterodelaroza/critic2/archive/1.0dev.tar.gz).

* The **stable version** works with almost any f90/f03 Fortran
  compiler. Only serious bugs will be fixed in the stable version.\\
  Version **1.0**: 
  [critic2-1.0stable.zip](https://github.com/aoterodelaroza/critic2/archive/1.0stable.zip),
  [critic2-1.0stable.tar.gz](https://github.com/aoterodelaroza/critic2/archive/1.0stable.tar.gz).

## Features

- Read and transform between file formats used in quantum chemistry
  and physics.

- Read, analyze, and manipulate scalar fields such as the ELF or the
  electron density. 

- Perform topological analysis of real-space scalar fields, which includes the
  implementation of Bader's atoms in molecules theory (QTAIM): critical
  point search, basin integration, basin plotting, etc.
  
- Calculation of Bader's delocalization indices in periodic solids.
   
- Calculation and integration of new scalar fields using critic2's
  powerful arithmetic expressions, useful in the development of
  quantum mechanical methods.

- Critic2 implements other related techniques, such as non-covalent
  interaction plots (NCIplots) in molecules and solids or the
  calculation of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) plots.

- Crystallographic calculations: space group detection (via the 
  [spglib](https://atztogo.github.io/spglib/)), unit cell
  transformation, powder diffraction and RDFs, structural comparison,
  molecule environment generation, and more.

- Critic2 understands structures and scalar fields generated by many
  programs in the field: WIEN2k, elk, PI, Quantum ESPRESSO, abinit,
  VASP, DFTB+, Gaussian, psi4, siesta, cif, SHELX, and more.
